# A Next.js, Redux, MySQL, Passport.js, JsonWebToken, Express Boilerplate

A next.js, passport.js ready boilerplate for my—and any other people's who want to use it—future projects. It overrides the default next.js server and its app and error page.

Just run
`npm install`
and then
`npm run start` to run it.
